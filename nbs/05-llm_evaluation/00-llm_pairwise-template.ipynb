To facilitate interfacing with LLMs in the biomedical space, while at the same time safeguarding their functionalities through sensible constraints, we propose a dedicated, open-source framework: BioChatter. Based on open-source software packages, we synergise the many functionalities that are currently developing around LLMs, such as knowledge integration / retrieval-augmented generation, model chaining, and benchmarking, resulting in an easy-to-use and inclusive framework for application in many use cases of biomedicine. We focus on robust and user-friendly implementation, including ways to deploy privacy-preserving local open-source LLMs. We demonstrate use cases via two multi-purpose web apps ([https://chat.biocypher.org](https://chat.biocypher.org)), and provide documentation, support, and an open community.'"
