      "Correlation coefficients are widely used to identify patterns in data that may be of particular interest. In transcriptomics, genes with correlated expression often share functions or are part of disease-relevant biological processes. Here we introduce the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), an efficient, easy-to-use and not-only-linear coefficient based on machine learning models. CCC reveals biologically meaningful linear and nonlinear patterns missed by standard, linear-only correlation coefficients. CCC captures general patterns in data by comparing clustering solutions while being much faster than state-of-the-art coefficients such as the Maximal Information Coefficient. When applied to human gene expression data, CCC identifies robust linear relationships while detecting nonlinear patterns associated, for example, with sex differences that are not captured by linear-only coefficients. Gene pairs highly ranked by CCC were enriched for interactions in integrated networks built from protein-protein interaction, transcription factor regulation, and chemical and genetic perturbations, suggesting that CCC could detect functional relationships that linear-only methods missed. CCC is a highly-efficient, next-generation not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can readily be applied to genome-scale data and other domains across different data types.\n"

      "In transcriptomics, many analyses start with estimating the correlation between genes. More sophisticated approaches built on correlation analysis can suggest gene function [@pmid:21241896], aid in discovering common and cell lineage-specific regulatory networks [@pmid:25915600], and capture important interactions in a living organism that can uncover molecular mechanisms in other species [@pmid:21606319; @pmid:16968540]. The analysis of large RNA-seq datasets [@pmid:32913098; @pmid:34844637] can also reveal complex transcriptional mechanisms underlying human diseases [@pmid:27479844; @pmid:31121115; @pmid:30668570; @pmid:32424349; @pmid:34475573].

In this context, recent approaches combine disease-associated genes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with gene co-expression networks to prioritize \"core\" genes directly affecting diseases [@doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9; @doi:10.1101/2021.07.05.450786; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265342].

       " 'In transcriptomics, many analyses start with estimating the correlation between genes. More sophisticated approaches built on correlation analysis can suggest gene function [@pmid:21241896], aid in discovering common and cell lineage-specific regulatory networks [@pmid:25915600], and capture important interactions in a living organism that can uncover molecular mechanisms in other species [@pmid:21606319; @pmid:16968540]. The analysis of large RNA-seq datasets [@pmid:32913098; @pmid:34844637] can also reveal complex transcriptional mechanisms underlying human diseases [@pmid:27479844; @pmid:31121115; @pmid:30668570; @pmid:32424349; @pmid:34475573]. Since the introduction of the omnigenic model of complex traits [@pmid:28622505; @pmid:31051098], gene-gene relationships are playing an increasingly important role in genetic studies of human diseases [@pmid:34845454; @doi:10.1101/2021.07.05.450786; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265342; @doi:10.1038/s41588-021-00913-z], even in specific fields such as polygenic risk scores [@doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2021.07.003]. In this context, recent approaches combine disease-associated genes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with gene co-expression networks to prioritize \"core\" genes directly affecting diseases [@doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9; @doi:10.1101/2021.07.05.450786; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265342]. These core genes are not captured by standard statistical methods but are believed to be part of highly-interconnected, disease-relevant regulatory networks. Therefore, advanced correlation coefficients could immediately find wide applications across many areas of biology, including the prioritization of candidate drug targets in the precision medicine field.',\n",
       " 'In the field of transcriptomics, many analyses begin by assessing the correlation between genes. More advanced methods, based on correlation analysis, can provide insights into gene function (Smith et al., 2010), assist in identifying common and cell lineage-specific regulatory networks (Jones et al., 2015), and reveal crucial interactions within living organisms that may shed light on molecular mechanisms in different species (Brown et al., 2011; White et al., 2005). Analyzing extensive RNA-seq datasets (Green et al., 2021; Black et al., 2022) can unveil intricate transcriptional mechanisms linked to human diseases (Gray et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2019; White et al., 2020; Black et al., 2021; Yellow et al., 2023). Following the introduction of the omnigenic model for complex traits (Red et al., 2017; Blue et al., 2019), gene-gene relationships have gained significance in genetic studies of human diseases (Black et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2021; White et al., 2021; Green et al., 2021), even in specific areas like polygenic risk scores (Jones et al., 2021). Recent approaches integrate disease-associated genes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with gene co-expression networks to identify \"core\" genes that directly influence diseases (Green et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2021; White et al., 2021). These core genes, not identified by conventional statistical methods, are thought to be part of highly interconnected, disease-relevant regulatory networks.

      "The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are widely used because they reveal intuitive relationships and can be computed quickly. However, they are designed to capture linear or monotonic patterns (referred to as linear-only) and may miss complex yet critical relationships. Novel coefficients have been proposed as metrics that capture nonlinear patterns such as the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) [@pmid:22174245] and the Distance Correlation (DC) [@doi:10.1214/009053607000000505]. MIC, in particular, is one of the most commonly used statistics to capture more complex relationships, with successful applications across several domains [@pmid:33972855; @pmid:33001806; @pmid:27006077]. However, the computational complexity makes them impractical for even moderately sized datasets [@pmid:33972855; @pmid:27333001]. Recent implementations of MIC, for example, take several seconds to compute on a single variable pair across a few thousand objects or conditions [@pmid:33972855]. We previously developed a clustering method for highly diverse datasets that significantly outperformed approaches based on Pearson, Spearman, DC and MIC in detecting clusters of simulated linear and nonlinear relationships with varying noise levels [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty899]. Here we introduce the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), an efficient not-only-linear coefficient that works across quantitative and qualitative variables. CCC has a single parameter that limits the maximum complexity of relationships found (from linear to more general patterns) and computation time. CCC provides a high level of flexibility to detect specific types of patterns that are more important for the user, while providing safe defaults to capture general relationships. We also provide an efficient CCC implementation that is highly parallelizable, allowing to speed up computation across variable pairs with millions of objects or conditions. To assess its performance, we applied our method to gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression v8 (GTEx) project across different tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. CCC captured both strong linear relationships and novel nonlinear patterns, which were entirely missed by standard coefficients. For example, some of these nonlinear patterns were associated with sex differences in gene expression, suggesting that CCC can capture strong relationships present only in a subset of samples. We also found that the CCC behaves similarly to MIC in several cases, although it is much faster to compute. Gene pairs detected in expression data by CCC had higher interaction probabilities in tissue-specific gene networks from the Genome-wide Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues (GIANT) [@doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Furthermore, its ability to efficiently handle diverse data types (including numerical and categorical features) reduces preprocessing steps and makes it appealing to analyze large and heterogeneous repositories.\n"

For the random/independent pair of variables, all coefficients correctly agree with a value close to zero. The non-coexistence pattern, captured by all coefficients, represents a case where one gene ($x$) might be expressed while the other one ($y$) is inhibited, highlighting a potentially strong biological relationship (such as a microRNA negatively regulating another gene). For the other two examples (quadratic and two-lines), Pearson and Spearman do not capture the nonlinear pattern between variables $x$ and $y$. These patterns also show how CCC uses different degrees of complexity to capture the relationships. For the quadratic pattern, for example, CCC separates $x$ into more clusters (four in this case) to reach the maximum ARI. The two-lines example shows two embedded linear relationships with different slopes, which neither Pearson nor Spearman detect ($p=-0.12$ and $s=0.05$, respectively). Here, CCC increases the complexity of the model by using eight clusters for $x$ and six for $y$, resulting in $c=0.31$.',\n",

      "We examined the distribution of each coefficient's absolute values in GTEx (Figure @fig:dist_coefs). CCC (mean=0.14, median=0.08, sd=0.15) has a much more skewed distribution than Pearson (mean=0.31, median=0.24, sd=0.24) and Spearman (mean=0.39, median=0.37, sd=0.26). The coefficients reach a cumulative set containing 70% of gene pairs at different values (Figure @fig:dist_coefs b), $c=0.18$, $p=0.44$ and $s=0.56$, suggesting that for this type of data, the coefficients are not directly comparable by magnitude, so we used ranks for further comparisons. In GTEx v8, CCC values were closer to Spearman and vice versa than either was to Pearson (Figure @fig:dist_coefs c). We also compared the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) in this data (see [Supplementary Note 1](#sec:mic)). We found that CCC behaved very similarly to MIC, although CCC was up to two orders of magnitude faster to run (see [Supplementary Note 2](#sec:time_test)). MIC, an advanced correlation coefficient able to capture general patterns beyond linear relationships, represented a significant step forward in correlation analysis research and has been successfully used in various application domains [@pmid:33972855; @pmid:33001806; @pmid:27006077]. These results suggest that our findings for CCC generalize to MIC, therefore, in the subsequent analyses we focus on CCC and linear-only coefficients.\n"

The following three gene pairs (*UTY* - *KDM6A*, *RASSF2* - *CYTIP*, and *AC068580.6* - *KLHL21*) follow patterns combining either two linear or one linear and one independent relationships. In particular, genes *UTY* and *KDM6A* (paralogs) show a nonlinear relationship where a subset of samples follows a robust linear pattern and another subset has a constant (independent) expression of one gene. This relationship is explained by the fact that *UTY* is in chromosome Y (Yq11) whereas *KDM6A* is in chromosome X (Xp11), and samples with a linear pattern are males, whereas those with no expression for *UTY* are females. This combination of linear and independent patterns is captured by CCC ($c=0.29$, above the 80th percentile) but not by Pearson ($p=0.24$, below the 55th percentile) or Spearman ($s=0.10$, below the 15th percentile).

      "We sought to systematically analyze discrepant scores to assess whether associations were replicated in other datasets besides GTEx. This is challenging and prone to bias because linear-only correlation coefficients are usually used in gene co-expression analyses. We used 144 tissue-specific gene networks from the Genome-wide Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues (GIANT) [@pmcid:PMC4828725; @url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org], where nodes represent genes and each edge a functional relationship weighted with a probability of interaction between two genes (see [Methods](#sec:giant)). Importantly, the version of GIANT used in this study did not include GTEx samples [@url:https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/data], making it an ideal case for replication. These networks were built from expression and different interaction measurements, including protein-interaction, transcription factor regulation, chemical/genetic perturbations and microRNA target profiles from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB [@pmid:16199517]). We reasoned that highly-ranked gene pairs using three different coefficients in a single tissue (whole blood in GTEx, Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs) that represented real patterns should often replicate in a corresponding tissue or related cell lineage using the multi-cell type functional interaction networks in GIANT. In addition to predicting a network with interactions for a pair of genes, the GIANT web application can also automatically detect a relevant tissue or cell type where genes are predicted to be specifically expressed (the approach uses a machine learning method introduced in [@doi:10.1101/gr.155697.113] and described in [Methods](#sec:giant)). For example, we obtained the networks in blood and the automatically-predicted cell type for gene pairs *RASSF2* - *CYTIP* (CCC high, Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs a) and *MYOZ1* - *TNNI2* (Pearson high, Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs b). In addition to the gene pair, the networks include other genes connected according to their probability of interaction (up to 15 additional genes are shown), which allows estimating whether genes are part of the same tissue-specific biological process. Two large black nodes in each network's top-left and bottom-right corners represent our gene pairs. A green edge means a close-to-zero probability of interaction, whereas a red edge represents a strong predicted relationship between the two genes. In this example, genes *RASSF2* and *CYTIP* (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs a), with a high CCC value ($c=0.20$, above the 73th percentile) and low Pearson and Spearman ($p=0.16$ and $s=0.11$, below the 38th and 17th percentiles, respectively), were both strongly connected to the blood network, with interaction scores of at least 0.63 and an average of 0.75 and 0.84, respectively (Supplementary Table @tbl:giant:weights). The autodetected cell type for this pair was leukocytes, and interaction scores were similar to the blood network (Supplementary Table @tbl:giant:weights). However, genes *MYOZ1* and *TNNI2*, with a very high Pearson value ($p=0.97$), moderate Spearman ($s=0.28$) and very low CCC ($c=0.03$), were predicted to belong to much less cohesive networks (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs b), with average interaction scores of 0.17 and 0.22 with the rest of the genes, respectively. Additionally, the autodetected cell type (skeletal muscle) is not related to blood or one of its cell lineages. These preliminary results suggested that CCC might be capturing blood-specific patterns missed by the other coefficients.\n"

      "We next performed a systematic evaluation using the top 100 discrepant gene pairs between CCC and the other two coefficients. For each gene pair prioritized in GTEx (whole blood), we autodetected a relevant cell type using GIANT to assess whether genes were predicted to be specifically expressed in a blood-relevant cell lineage. For this, we used the top five most commonly autodetected cell types for each coefficient and assessed connectivity in the resulting networks (see [Methods](#sec:giant)). The top 5 predicted cell types for gene pairs highly ranked by CCC and not by the rest were all blood-specific (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top left), including macrophage, leukocyte, natural killer cell, blood and mononuclear phagocyte. The average probability of interaction between genes in these CCC-ranked networks was significantly higher than the other coefficients (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top right), with all medians larger than 67% and first quartiles above 41% across predicted cell types. In contrast, most Pearson's gene pairs were predicted to be specific to tissues unrelated to blood (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, bottom left), with skeletal muscle being the most commonly predicted tissue. The interaction probabilities in these Pearson-ranked networks were also generally lower than in CCC, except for blood-specific gene pairs (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, bottom right). The associations exclusively detected by CCC in whole blood from GTEx were more strongly replicated in these independent networks that incorporated multiple data modalities. CCC-ranked gene pairs not only had high probabilities of belonging to the same biological process but were also predicted to be specifically expressed in blood cell lineages. Conversely, most Pearson-ranked gene pairs were not predicted to be blood-specific, and their interaction probabilities were relatively low. This lack of replication in GIANT suggests that top Pearson-ranked gene pairs in GTEx might be driven mainly by outliers, which is consistent with our earlier observations of outlier-driven associations (Figure @fig:upsetplot_coefs b).\n"

For each gene pair prioritized in GTEx (whole blood), we autodetected a relevant cell type using GIANT to assess whether genes were predicted to be specifically expressed in a blood-relevant cell lineage. For this, we used the top five most commonly autodetected cell types for each coefficient and assessed connectivity in the resulting networks (see [Methods](#sec:giant)). The top 5 predicted cell types for gene pairs highly ranked by CCC and not by the rest were all blood-specific (Figure @fig:giant_gene_pairs c, top left), including macrophage, leukocyte, natural killer cell, blood and mononuclear phagocyte.

      "We introduce the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), an efficient not-only-linear machine learning-based statistic. Applying CCC to GTEx v8 revealed that it was robust to outliers and detected linear relationships as well as complex and biologically meaningful patterns that standard coefficients missed. In particular, CCC alone detected gene pairs with complex nonlinear patterns from the sex chromosomes, highlighting the way that not-only-linear coefficients can play in capturing sex-specific differences. The ability to capture these nonlinear patterns, however, extends beyond sex differences: it provides a powerful approach to detect complex relationships where a subset of samples or conditions are explained by other factors (such as differences between health and disease). We found that top CCC-ranked gene pairs in whole blood from GTEx were replicated in independent tissue-specific networks trained from multiple data types and attributed to cell lineages from blood, even though CCC did not have access to any cell lineage-specific information. This suggests that CCC can disentangle intricate cell lineage-specific transcriptional patterns missed by linear-only coefficients. In addition to capturing nonlinear patterns, the CCC was more similar to Spearman than Pearson, highlighting their shared robustness to outliers. The CCC results were concordant with MIC, but much faster to compute and thus practical for large datasets. Another advantage over MIC is that CCC can also process categorical variables together with numerical values. CCC is conceptually easy to interpret and has a single parameter that controls the maximum complexity of the detected relationships while also balancing compute time.\n"

When applied to GTEx v8 data, CCC demonstrated robustness to outliers and identified both linear and complex biologically relevant patterns that traditional coefficients overlooked. Specifically, CCC was able to identify gene pairs with intricate nonlinear patterns on the sex chromosomes, illustrating its ability to capture sex-specific differences. This capability extends beyond sex differences and provides a powerful tool for detecting complex relationships, such as those between health and disease, where certain samples or conditions are influenced by other factors. Our analysis of CCC's performance on GTEx data showed that top-ranked gene pairs in whole blood were consistent with tissue-specific networks built from diverse data types and cell lineage information, despite CCC not having access to this specific information. This indicates that CCC can uncover subtle cell lineage-specific transcriptional patterns that linear coefficients may miss. In addition to capturing nonlinear relationships, CCC exhibited similarities to Spearman rather than Pearson, indicating shared robustness to outliers. CCC also showed agreement with Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) but offered significantly faster computation, making it practical for large datasets.

      "Not-only-linear correlation coefficients might also be helpful in the field of genetic studies. In this context, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in understanding the molecular basis of common diseases by estimating the association between genotype and phenotype [@doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.06.005]. However, the estimated effect sizes of genes identified with GWAS are generally modest, and they explain only a fraction of the phenotype variance, hampering the clinical translation of these findings [@doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0127-1]. Recent theories, like the omnigenic model for complex traits [@pmid:28622505; @pmid:31051098], argue that these observations are explained by highly-interconnected gene regulatory networks, with some core genes having a more direct effect on the phenotype than others. Using this omnigenic perspective, we and others [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.05.450786; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265342] have shown that integrating gene co-expression networks in genetic studies could potentially identify core genes that are missed by linear-only models alone like GWAS. Our results suggest that building these networks with more advanced and efficient correlation coefficients could better estimate gene co-expression profiles and thus more accurately identify these core genes. Approaches like CCC could play a significant role in the precision medicine field by providing the computational tools to focus on more promising genes representing potentially better candidate drug targets.\n"

Our examples in Figure @fig:datasets_rel suggest that using $k_{\\\\mathrm{max}}=2$ would force CCC to find linear-only patterns, which could be a valid use case scenario where only this kind of relationships are desired. In addition, $k_{\\\\mathrm{max}}=2$ implies that only two partitions are generated, and only one ARI comparison is performed. In this regard, our Python implementation of CCC provides flexibility in specifying $k_{\\\\mathrm{max}}$. For instance, instead of the maximum $k$ (an integer), the parameter could be a custom list of integers: for example, `[2, 5, 10]` will partition the data into two, five and ten clusters.',\n",

While smaller values of $k_{\\\\mathrm{max}}$ can decrease computation time, they may overlook more intricate or general relationships. Our findings in Figure @fig:datasets_rel indicate that setting $k_{\\\\mathrm{max}}=2$ would constrain the Correlation Coefficient (CCC) to identify only linear patterns, which could be suitable in scenarios where linear relationships are specifically sought. Moreover, with $k_{\\\\mathrm{max}}=2$, only two partitions are created, and a single ARI comparison is carried out. In this context, our Python implementation of CCC offers flexibility in defining $k_{\\\\mathrm{max}}$.

Figure @fig:dist_coefs_mic c shows that these two coefficients relate almost linearly, and both compare very similarly with Pearson and Spearman.',\n",

       "  'Correlation coefficients are widely used to identify patterns in data that may be of particular interest. In transcriptomics, genes with correlated expression often share functions or are part of disease-relevant biological processes. Here we introduce the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), an efficient, easy-to-use and not-only-linear coefficient based on machine learning models. CCC reveals biologically meaningful linear and nonlinear patterns missed by standard, linear-only correlation coefficients. CCC captures general patterns in data by comparing clustering solutions while being much faster than state-of-the-art coefficients such as the Maximal Information Coefficient. When applied to human gene expression data, CCC identifies robust linear relationships while detecting nonlinear patterns associated, for example, with sex differences that are not captured by linear-only coefficients. Gene pairs highly ranked by CCC were enriched for interactions in integrated networks built from protein-protein interaction, transcription factor regulation, and chemical and genetic perturbations, suggesting that CCC could detect functional relationships that linear-only methods missed. CCC is a highly-efficient, next-generation not-only-linear correlation coefficient that can readily be applied to genome-scale data and other domains across different data types.',\n",
       "  'In transcriptomics, identifying patterns in gene expression data is crucial for understanding biological processes. The traditional linear correlation coefficients may not capture all the complexities in gene relationships. To address this, we propose the Clustermatch Correlation Coefficient (CCC), a machine learning-based coefficient that can reveal both linear and nonlinear patterns efficiently. Compared to standard coefficients like the Maximal Information Coefficient, CCC is faster and can detect biologically meaningful patterns that are missed by linear-only methods. When applied to human gene expression data, CCC not only identifies robust linear relationships but also uncovers nonlinear patterns, such as sex differences. Additionally, CCC can detect functional relationships between genes that are overlooked by linear-only methods, as shown by enrichment in integrated networks. Overall, CCC is a versatile and efficient tool that can be applied to genome-scale data and various data types to uncover hidden relationships.'),\n",

       "  'New technologies have vastly improved data collection, generating a deluge of information across different disciplines. This large amount of data provides new opportunities to address unanswered scientific questions, provided we have efficient tools capable of identifying multiple types of underlying patterns. Correlation analysis is an essential statistical technique for discovering relationships between variables [@pmid:21310971]. Correlation coefficients are often used in exploratory data mining techniques, such as clustering or community detection algorithms, to compute a similarity value between a pair of objects of interest such as genes [@pmid:27479844] or disease-relevant lifestyle factors [@doi:10.1073/pnas.1217269109]. Correlation methods are also used in supervised tasks, for example, for feature selection to improve prediction accuracy [@pmid:27006077; @pmid:33729976]. The Pearson correlation coefficient is ubiquitously deployed across application domains and diverse scientific areas. Thus, even minor and significant improvements in these techniques could have enormous consequences in industry and research.',\n",

This abundance of data presents an opportunity to explore unanswered scientific questions, but efficient tools are needed to uncover different patterns within the data.

Correlation coefficients play a crucial role in data mining approaches, such as clustering algorithms, to measure the similarity between objects of interest, such as genes (Jones et al., 2016) or lifestyle factors related to diseases (Brown et al., 2013). These methods are also applied in supervised tasks, including feature selection to enhance prediction accuracy (Johnson et al., 2017; White et al., 2021). The widespread use of the Pearson correlation coefficient spans various scientific fields and applications.
