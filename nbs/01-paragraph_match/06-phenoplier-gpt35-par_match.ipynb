      "Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n"

      "Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.\n"

      "In this paper titled 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms,' we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic method that offers a gene module viewpoint for genetic studies. Our approach is versatile, allowing the integration of various data types into a unified representation for comprehensive analysis. Through the module perspective, we can deduce how clusters of functionally-related genes impact complex traits, identify shared and unique transcriptomic characteristics among traits, and predict the effects of pharmacological interventions on gene activity. PhenoPLIER aligns gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses within a shared latent representation. To achieve this, we merge numerous gene-trait associations (via TWAS from PhenomeXcan) and drug transcriptional profiles (from LINCS L1000) into a low-dimensional space derived from public gene expression data from tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2). We employ a matrix factorization technique to define a latent representation that extracts gene modules while adhering to sparsity constraints and preferences for pathways based on prior knowledge. By mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we find significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. For instance, hypothyroidism correlates with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays with specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with various brain cell types. We also observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan replicate in the eMERGE network phase III. Additionally, we conduct a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation in HepG2 cells, revealing stronger trait associations with modules than individual genes, even when known lipid metabolism genes do not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to single-gene approaches, our module-based method better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease connections by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked to drug mechanisms (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via an immune mechanism). This enhanced drug-disease prediction suggests that modules offer a more effective way to explore drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space uncovers stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch linking lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER moves beyond individual genes to encompass groups of genes working together to perform various functions in specific cell types. This approach enhances the robustness of identifying and interpreting genetic associations, prioritizing alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are absent. This method signifies a shift in interpreting genetic studies, offering mechanistic insights to improve the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic approaches.\n"

       " \"Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.\",\n",

      "Each LV or gene module represents a group of weighted genes expressed together in the same tissues and cell types as a functional unit. Since LVs might represent a functional set of genes regulated by the same transcriptional program [@doi:10.1186/1471-2164-7-187; @doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1835-8], we conjecture that the projection of TWAS and pharmacologic perturbations data into this latent space could provide a better mechanistic understanding. For this projection of different data modalities into the same space, PhenoPLIER converts gene associations to an LV score: all genes' standardized effect sizes for a trait (from TWAS) or differential expression values for a drug (from pharmacologic perturbation data) are multiplied by the LV genes' weights and summed, producing a single value. Instead of looking at individual genes, this process links different traits and drugs to functionally-related groups of genes or LVs. PhenoPLIER uses LVs annotations about the specific conditions where the group of genes is expressed, such as cell types and tissues, even at specific developmental stages, disease stages or under distinct stimuli. Although this is not strictly necessary for PhenoPLIER to work, these annotations can dramatically improve the interpretability of results. MultiPLIER's models provide this information by linking LVs to samples, which may be annotated for experimental conditions (represented by matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ at the top of Figure {@fig:entire_process}b) in which genes in an LV are expressed. An example of this is shown in Figure {@fig:entire_process}c. In the original MultiPLIER study, the authors reported that one of the latent variables, identified as LV603, was associated with a known neutrophil pathway and highly correlated with neutrophil count estimates from whole blood RNA-seq profiles [@doi:10.1186/s13059-016-1070-5]. We analyzed LV603 using PhenoPLIER and found that 1) neutrophil counts and other white blood cell traits were ranked among the top 10 traits out of 4,091 (Figure {@fig:entire_process}c, bottom), and basophils count and percentage were significantly associated with this LV when using our regression method (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv603), and 2) LV603's genes were expressed in highly relevant cell types (Figure {@fig:entire_process}c, top). These initial results suggested that groups of functionally related and co-expressed genes tend to correspond to groups of trait-associated genes, and the approach can link transcriptional mechanisms from large and diverse dataset collections to complex traits.\n"

      "Therefore, PhenoPLIER allows the user to address specific questions, namely: do disease-associated genes belong to modules expressed in specific tissues and cell types?

      "Two high-confidence genes from our CRISPR screening, *DGAT2* and *ACACA*, are responsible for encoding enzymes for triglycerides and fatty acid synthesis and were among the highest-weighted genes of LV246 (Figure {@fig:lv246}b, in boldface). However, in contrast to other members of LV246, *DGAT2* and *ACACA* were not associated nor colocalized with any of the cardiovascular-related traits and thus would not have been prioritized by TWAS alone; instead, other members of LV246, such as *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR*, were significantly associated and colocalized with lipid-related traits. This lack of association of two high-confidence genes from our CRISPR screen might be explained from an omnigenic point of view [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014]. Assuming that the TWAS models for *DGAT2* and *ACACA* capture all common *cis*-eQTLs (the only genetic component of gene expression that TWAS can capture) and there are no rare *cis*-eQTLs, these two genes might represent \"core\" genes (i.e., they directly affect the trait with no mediated regulation of other genes), and many of the rest in the LV are \"peripheral\" genes that *trans*-regulate them.\n"

      "Two high-confidence genes identified in our CRISPR screening, DGAT2 and ACACA, encode enzymes for triglycerides and fatty acid synthesis and were among the highest-weighted genes of LV246 (Figure 2b).

Instead, genes like SCD, LPL, FADS2, HMGCR, and LDLR in LV246 showed significant associations with lipid-related traits.

However, in contrast to other members of LV246, *DGAT2* and *ACACA* were not associated nor colocalized with any of the cardiovascular-related traits and thus would not have been prioritized by TWAS alone; instead, other members of LV246, such as *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR*, were significantly associated and colocalized with lipid-related traits. This lack of association of two high-confidence genes from our CRISPR screen might be explained from an omnigenic point of view [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014]. Assuming that the TWAS models for *DGAT2* and *ACACA* capture all common *cis*-eQTLs (the only genetic component of gene expression that TWAS can capture) and there are no rare *cis*-eQTLs, these two genes might represent \"core\" genes (i.e., they directly affect the trait with no mediated regulation of other genes), and many of the rest in the LV are \"peripheral\" genes that *trans*-regulate them.',\n",

      "We examined a specific drug-disease pair to determine whether the LVs driving the prediction were biologically plausible. Nicotinic acid (niacin) is a B vitamin widely used clinically to treat lipid disorders, although there is controversy on its clinical utility in preventing cardiovascular disease [@pmid:22085343; @pmid:25014686; @pmid:30977858]. Niacin exerts its effects on multiple tissues, although its mechanisms are not well understood [@doi:10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.02.029; @doi:10.1194/jlr.S092007; @pmid:24363242; @pmid:24713591]. This compound can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by inhibiting an HDL catabolism receptor in the liver. Niacin also inhibits diacylglycerol acyltransferase–2 (DGAT2), which decreases the production of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) either by modulating triglyceride synthesis in hepatocytes or by inhibiting adipocyte triglyceride lipolysis [@doi:10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.02.029]. Niacin was one of the drugs in the gold standard set indicated for atherosclerosis (AT) and coronary artery disease (CAD). We observed that this compound was predicted by the gene-based and LV-based approach as a medical indication for coronary artery disease (CAD), with scores above the mean (0.51 and 0.96, respectively). For AT, the LV-based approach predicted niacin as a therapeutic drug with a score of 0.52, whereas the gene-based method assigned a negative score of -0.01 (below the mean). Since LVs represent interpretable features associated with specific cell types, we analyzed which LVs positively contributed to these predictions (i.e., with an opposite direction between niacin and the disease). Notably, LV246 (Figure @fig:lv246), expressed in adipose tissue and liver and associated with plasma lipids and high cholesterol (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv246), was the 16th most important module in the prediction of niacin as a therapeutic drug for AT. Besides the gold standard set, LV246 was among the top modules for other cardiovascular diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease (wide definition, 15th module) and high cholesterol (7th module).\n"

       " 'We examined a specific drug-disease pair to determine whether the LVs driving the prediction were biologically plausible. Nicotinic acid (niacin) is a B vitamin widely used clinically to treat lipid disorders, although there is controversy on its clinical utility in preventing cardiovascular disease [@pmid:22085343; @pmid:25014686; @pmid:30977858]. Niacin exerts its effects on multiple tissues, although its mechanisms are not well understood [@doi:10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.02.029; @doi:10.1194/jlr.S092007; @pmid:24363242; @pmid:24713591]. This compound can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by inhibiting an HDL catabolism receptor in the liver. Niacin also inhibits diacylglycerol acyltransferase–2 (DGAT2), which decreases the production of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) either by modulating triglyceride synthesis in hepatocytes or by inhibiting adipocyte triglyceride lipolysis [@doi:10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.02.029]. Niacin was one of the drugs in the gold standard set indicated for atherosclerosis (AT) and coronary artery disease (CAD). We observed that this compound was predicted by the gene-based and LV-based approach as a medical indication for coronary artery disease (CAD), with scores above the mean (0.51 and 0.96, respectively). For AT, the LV-based approach predicted niacin as a therapeutic drug with a score of 0.52, whereas the gene-based method assigned a negative score of -0.01 (below the mean). Since LVs represent interpretable features associated with specific cell types, we analyzed which LVs positively contributed to these predictions (i.e., with an opposite direction between niacin and the disease). Notably, LV246 (Figure @fig:lv246), expressed in adipose tissue and liver and associated with plasma lipids and high cholesterol (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv246), was the 16th most important module in the prediction of niacin as a therapeutic drug for AT. Besides the gold standard set, LV246 was among the top modules for other cardiovascular diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease (wide definition, 15th module) and high cholesterol (7th module).',\n",

      "We used the projection of gene-trait associations into the latent space to find groups of clusters linked by the same transcriptional processes. Since individual clustering algorithms have different biases (i.e., assumptions about the data structure), we designed a consensus clustering framework that combines solutions or partitions of traits generated by different methods ([Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)). Consensus or ensemble approaches have been recommended to avoid several pitfalls when performing cluster analysis on biological data [@doi:10.1126/scisignal.aad1932]. Since diversity in the ensemble is crucial for these methods, we generated different data versions which were processed using different methods with varying sets of parameters (Figure {@fig:clustering:design}a). Then, a consensus function combines the ensemble into a consolidated solution, which has been shown to outperform any individual member of the ensemble [@Strehl2002; @doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2005.113]. Our clustering pipeline generated 15 final consensus clustering solutions (Figure @fig:sup:clustering:agreement). The number of clusters of these partitions (between 5 to 29) was learned from the data by selecting the partitions with the largest agreement with the ensemble [@Strehl2002]. Instead of selecting one of these final solutions with a specific number of clusters, we used a clustering tree [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giy083] (Figure @fig:clustering:tree) to examine stable groups of traits across multiple resolutions. To understand which latent variables differentiated the group of traits, we trained a decision tree classifier on the input data $\\hat{\\mathbf{M}}$ using the clusters found as labels (Figure {@fig:clustering:design}b, see [Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)).\n"

      "Next, we analyzed which LVs were driving these clusters of traits. For this, we trained decision tree classifiers on the input data using each cluster at $k$=29 (bottom of Figure @fig:clustering:tree) as labels (see [Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)). This procedure yielded the top LVs that were most discriminative for each cluster. Several of these LVs were well-aligned to existing pathways (Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap), whereas others were not aligned to prior knowledge but still expressed in relevant tissues (Figure @fig:sup:clustering:novel:heatmap). In Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap, it can be seen that some LVs were highly specific to certain traits, while others were associated with a wide range of different phenotypes, thus potentially involved in more general biological functions. We used our regression framework to determine whether these LVs were significantly associated with different traits. For example, LVs such as LV928 and LV30, which were well-aligned to early progenitors of the erythrocytes lineage [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2011.01.004] (Tables @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv928 and @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv30), were predominantly expressed in early differentiation stages of erythropoiesis (Figures @fig:sup:lv928 and @fig:sup:lv30) and strongly associated with different assays on red blood cells (FDR < 0.05; Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv928, @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv928, and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv30). In contrast, other LVs were highly specific, such as LV730, which is expressed in thrombocytes from different cancer samples (Figure @fig:sup:lv730 and Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv730), and strongly associated with hematological assays on platelets (FDR < 0.05, Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv730); or LV598, whose genes were expressed in corneal endothelial cells (Figure @fig:sup:lv598 and Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv598) and associated with keratometry measurements (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv598).\n"

For this, we trained decision tree classifiers on the input data using each cluster at $k$=29 (bottom of Figure @fig:clustering:tree) as labels (see [Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)). This procedure yielded the top LVs that were most discriminative for each cluster. Several of these LVs were well-aligned to existing pathways (Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap), whereas others were not aligned to prior knowledge but still expressed in relevant tissues (Figure @fig:sup:clustering:novel:heatmap). In Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap, it can be seen that some LVs were highly specific to certain traits, while others were associated with a wide range of different phenotypes, thus potentially involved in more general biological functions. We used our regression framework to determine whether these LVs were significantly associated with different traits. For example, LVs such as LV928 and LV30, which were well-aligned to early progenitors of the erythrocytes lineage [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2011.01.004] (Tables @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv928 and @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv30), were predominantly expressed in early differentiation stages of erythropoiesis (Figures @fig:sup:lv928 and @fig:sup:lv30) and strongly associated with different assays on red blood cells (FDR < 0.05; Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv928, @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv928, and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv30).

In eMERGE, this LV was associated with coronary atherosclerosis (phecode: 411.4) (Table @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv136). LV136 was expressed in a wide range of cell types, including fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, pancreatic stellate cells, cardiomyocytes, and adipocytes (Figure @fig:sup:lv136). Within the cardiovascular sub-branch, we found neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These disorders were previously linked to the cardiovascular system [@pmid:12093424; @doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002065; @doi:10.1192/bjp.bp.117.202606; @doi:10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313563] and share several risk factors, including hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking, among others [@doi:10.1186/s12916-014-0206-2; @doi:10.1111/j.1076-7460.2007.06696.x]. However, our results grouped these diseases by potentially shared transcriptional processes expressed in specific tissues/cell types. Alzheimer's disease (not present in eMERGE), for instance, was significantly associated with LV21 in PhenomeXcan (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv21). LV21, a gene module not aligned to prior pathways, was strongly expressed in a variety of soft tissue sarcomas, monocytes/macrophages (including microglia from cortex samples), and aortic valves (Figure @fig:sup:lv21 and Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv21). This LV was also strongly associated with lipids and high cholesterol in PhenomeXcan and hyperlipidemia (phecode: 272.1) in eMERGE (Table @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv21). As discussed previously, macrophages play a key role in the reverse cholesterol transport and thus atherogenesis [@doi:10.1093/qjmed/hci136], and lipid metabolism in microglia has been recently identified as an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases [@doi:10.3389/fphys.2020.00393].\n"

These disorders share risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and smoking. Alzheimer's disease was significantly associated with LV21 in PhenomeXcan, which was strongly expressed in soft tissue sarcomas, monocytes/macrophages, and aortic valves. LV21 was also associated with lipids and high cholesterol in PhenomeXcan and hyperlipidemia in eMERGE. Macrophages play a crucial role in reverse cholesterol transport and atherogenesis, while lipid metabolism in microglia is important in neurodegenerative diseases.\n"

       " \"The cardiovascular sub-branch had 129 significant LV-trait associations in PhenomeXcan and 23 in eMERGE. LV136, aligned with known collagen formation and muscle contraction pathways (Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv136), was associated with coronary artery disease and keratometry measurements in PhenomeXcan (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv136). In eMERGE, this LV was associated with coronary atherosclerosis (phecode: 411.4) (Table @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv136). LV136 was expressed in a wide range of cell types, including fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, pancreatic stellate cells, cardiomyocytes, and adipocytes (Figure @fig:sup:lv136). Within the cardiovascular sub-branch, we found neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These disorders were previously linked to the cardiovascular system [@pmid:12093424; @doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002065; @doi:10.1192/bjp.bp.117.202606; @doi:10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313563] and share several risk factors, including hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, smoking, among others [@doi:10.1186/s12916-014-0206-2; @doi:10.1111/j.1076-7460.2007.06696.x]. However, our results grouped these diseases by potentially shared transcriptional processes expressed in specific tissues/cell types. Alzheimer's disease (not present in eMERGE), for instance, was significantly associated with LV21 in PhenomeXcan (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv21). LV21, a gene module not aligned to prior pathways, was strongly expressed in a variety of soft tissue sarcomas, monocytes/macrophages (including microglia from cortex samples), and aortic valves (Figure @fig:sup:lv21 and Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv21). This LV was also strongly associated with lipids and high cholesterol in PhenomeXcan and hyperlipidemia (phecode: 272.1) in eMERGE (Table @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv21). As discussed previously, macrophages play a key role in the reverse cholesterol transport and thus atherogenesis [@doi:10.1093/qjmed/hci136], and lipid metabolism in microglia has been recently identified as an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases [@doi:10.3389/fphys.2020.00393].\",\n",

      "We found that the analysis of associations through latent representations provided reasonable groupings of diseases and traits affected by shared and distinct transcriptional mechanisms expressed in highly relevant tissues. Our cluster analysis approach also detected the LVs that were most discriminative for each cluster. Several of these LVs were also significantly associated with different traits. Some LVs were strongly aligned with known pathways, but others (like LV57) were not, which might represent novel disease-relevant mechanisms. In some cases, the features/LVs linked to phenotypes appear to be associated with specific cell types. Associations with such cell type marker genes may reveal potentially causal cell types for a phenotype with more precision. We observed modules expressed primarily in one tissue (such as adipose in LV246 or ovary in LV66). Others appeared to be expressed in many contexts, which may capture pathways associated with related complex diseases. For example, LV136 is associated with cardiovascular disease and measures of corneal biomechanics and is expressed in fibroblasts, osteoblasts, pancreas, liver, and cardiomyocytes, among others. Other examples include LV844, expressed in whole blood samples and associated with a range of autoimmune diseases; or LV57, which is clearly expressed in T cells and strongly associated with autoimmune and venous thromboembolism. From an omnigenic point of view, these patterns might represent cases of \"network pleiotropy,\" where the same cell types mediate molecularly related traits. To our knowledge, projection through a representation learned on complementary but distinct datasets is a novel approach to identifying cell type and pathway effects on complex phenotypes that is computationally simple to implement.\n"

For instance, LV136, associated with cardiovascular disease and corneal biomechanics, was expressed in various cell types including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, pancreas, liver, and cardiomyocytes. Another example is LV844, expressed in whole blood samples and linked to autoimmune diseases, or LV57, expressed in T cells and associated with autoimmune conditions and venous thromboembolism. These patterns may reflect instances of \"network pleiotropy,\" where the same cell types influence molecularly related traits.

We used PhenomeXcan as a discovery cohort across four thousand traits, and many LV-trait associations replicated in eMERGE. In PhenomeXcan, we found 3,450 significant LV-trait associations (FDR < 0.05) with 686 LVs (out of 987) associated with at least one trait and 1,176 traits associated with at least one LV. In eMERGE, we found 196 significant LV-trait associations, with 116 LVs associated with at least one trait/phecode and 81 traits with at least one LV. We only focused on a few disease types from our trait clusters, but the complete set of associations on other disease domains is available in our [Github repository](https://github.com/greenelab/phenoplier) for future research. As noted in [Methods](#sec:methods:reg), one limitation of the regression approach is that the gene-gene correlations are only approximately accurate, which could lead to false positives if the correlation among the top genes in a module is not precisely captured. The regression model, however, is approximately well-calibrated, and we did not observe inflation when running the method in real data.',\n",

      "Our approach rests on the assumption that gene modules with coordinated expression patterns will also manifest coordinated pathological effects. Our implementation in this work integrates two complementary approaches. The first is MultiPLIER, which extracts latent variables from large expression datasets, and these LVs could represent either real transcriptional processes or technical factors (\"batch effects\"). We used a previously published model derived from recount2, which was designed to analyze rare disorders but might not be the optimal latent representation for the wide range of complex diseases considered here. Also, the underlying factorization method rests on linear combinations of variables, which could miss important and more complex co-expression patterns. In addition, recount2, the training dataset used, has since been surpassed in size and scale by other resources [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1101/2021.05.21.445138]. However, it is important to note that our models impose very few assumptions on the latent expression representation. Therefore, we should be able to easily replace MultiPLIER with other similar approaches like GenomicSuperSignature [@doi:10.1038/s41467-022-31411-3]. The second approach we used in this study is TWAS, where we are only considering the hypothesis that GWAS loci affect traits via changes in gene expression. Other effects, such as coding variants disrupting protein-protein interactions, are not captured. Additionally, TWAS has several limitations that can lead to false positives [@doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0385-z; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.11.012]. Like GWAS, which generally detects groups of associated variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD), TWAS usually identifies several genes within the same locus [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0092-1; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This is due to sharing of GWAS variants in gene expression models, correlated expression of nearby genes, or even correlation of their predicted expression due to eQTLs in LD, among others [@doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0385-z]. Our LV-based regression framework, however, accounts for these gene-gene correlations in TWAS reasonably well.\n"

In our analysis, we prioritized drugs for diseases with diverse tissue origins, highlighting the challenge of selecting the most suitable tissue model from Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) to identify reversed transcriptome patterns between genes and drug-induced changes.')"

Given the high correlation between predicted expression values for a gene across different tissues, MultiXcan uses the principal components (PCs) of $\\\\mathbf{T}$ to avoid collinearity issues. S-MultiXcan derives the joint regression estimates (effect sizes and their variances) in Equation (@eq:multixcan) using the marginal estimates from S-PrediXcan in Equation (@eq:spredixcan).

Since $\\\\mathbf{T}^{\\\\top}\\\\mathbf{T}$ is singular for many genes, S-MultiXcan computes the pseudo-inverse $Cor(\\\\mathbf{T})^{+}$ using the $k$ top PCs, and thus $\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}}^{\\\\top} Cor(\\\\mathbf{T})^{+} \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{z}} \\\\sim \\\\chi_k^2$. To arrive at this expression, S-MultiXcan uses the conservative approximation $\\\\sigma_{e}^{2} \\\\approx \\\\sigma_{\\\\epsilon}^{2}$, that is, the variance of the error terms in the joint regression is approximately equal to the residual variance of the marginal regressions. Another important point is that $Cor(\\\\mathbf{T})$ is estimated using a global genotype covariance matrix, whereas marginal $\\\\hat{z}_l$ in Equation (@eq:spredixcan) are approximated using tissue-specific genotype covariances. Although S-MultiXcan yields highly concordant estimates compared with MultiXcan, results are not perfectly correlated across genes [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889].

      "Note that, since we used the MultiXcan regression model (Equation (@eq:multixcan)), $\\mathbf{R}$ is only an approximation of gene correlations in S-MultiXcan. As explained before, S-MultiXcan approximates the joint regression parameters in MultiXcan using the marginal regression estimates from S-PrediXcan in (@eq:spredixcan) with some simplifying assumptions and different genotype covariance matrices.

For $k$-means, spectral clustering and GMM, we specified a range of $k$ between 2 and $\\sqrt{n} \\approx 60$, and for each $k$ we generated five partitions using random seeds. For hierarchical clustering, for each $k$, we generated four partitions using common linkage criteria: ward, complete, average and single.

Stagger sequence (0-8nt) was included in P5 and 8bp uniquely barcoded sequence in P7. Primers were synthesized through Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), and each primer was PAGE purified. 32 PCR reactions were set up for each condition. Each 100ul PCR reaction consists of roughly 5ug of gDNA, 5ul of each 10uM P5 and P7. ExTaq DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa, Cat. RR001A) was used to amplify the amplicon. PCR Thermal Cycler Parameters set as Initial at 95oC for 1min; followed by 24 cycles of Denaturation at 94oC for 30 seconds, Annealing at 52.5oC for 30 seconds, Extension at 72oC for 30 seconds. A final Elongation at 72oC for 10 minutes. 285bp-293bp PCR products were expected (Figure @fig:sup:crispr:fig4 A). PCR products within the same condition were pooled and purified using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat. B23318). Purified Illumina libraries were quantitated on Qubit, and the quality of the library was analyzed on Bio-analyzer using High Sensitivity DNA Chip. A single approximate 285bp peak was expected (Figure @fig:sup:crispr:fig4 B). Final Illumina library samples were sequenced on Nova-seq 6000. Samples were pooled and loaded on an SP flow cell, along with a 20% PhiX control v3 library spike-in.\n"

      "**Illumina libraries generation and sequencing.** The fragment containing the sgRNA cassette was amplified using P5/P7 primers, as indicated in (Doench et al., 2016), and primer sequences were adapted from the Broad Institute protocol (Figure 1). The stagger sequence (0-8 nt) was included in P5, and an 8 bp uniquely barcoded sequence was included in P7. Primers were synthesized through Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), and each primer was PAGE purified. 32 PCR reactions were set up for each condition. Each 100 μl PCR reaction consisted of roughly 5 μg of gDNA, 5 μl of each 10 μM P5 and P7 primers. ExTaq DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa, Cat. RR001A) was used to amplify the amplicon. The PCR thermal cycler parameters were set as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min; followed by 24 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 52.5°C for 30 seconds, extension at 72°C for 30 seconds. A final elongation step at 72°C for 10 minutes was performed. PCR products of 285-293 bp were expected (Figure 2A). PCR products within the same condition were pooled and purified using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat. B23318). The purified Illumina libraries were quantitated on Qubit, and the quality of the library was analyzed on a Bioanalyzer using a High Sensitivity DNA Chip. A single approximate 285 bp peak was expected (Figure 2B). The final Illumina library samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000.

       "  'Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.',\n",
