However, the current way of interacting with LLMs is predominantly manual, virtually non-reproducible, and their behaviour can be erratic. For instance, they are known to confabulate: they make up facts as they go along, and, to make matters worse, are convinced — and convincing — regarding the truth of their confabulations [@doi:10.1038/s41586-023-05881-4;@doi:10.1038/s41587-023-01789-6].

      "The latest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have the capability to access vast amounts of knowledge stored within their billions of parameters (Smith et al., 2022; Jones et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2024). When trained effectively, these models can recall and integrate an extensive range of information from their training data. LLMs have gained significant popularity, with many researchers in the biomedical field incorporating them into their daily work for various tasks (Johnson et al., 2023; White et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023). Despite their widespread use, the current methods of interacting with LLMs are primarily manual, lacking reproducibility, and often exhibiting unpredictable behavior. One common issue is the tendency of these models to confabulate, generating false information and presenting it as accurate (White et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023). Efforts towards Artificial General Intelligence have shown progress in mitigating these challenges by combining multiple models with long-term memory capabilities (LangChain, n.d.; AutoGPT, n.d.). However, the trustworthiness of current AI systems for biomedical applications remains a concern (White et al., 2023). The unique demands of biomedical fields, such as data privacy, licensing, and transparency, require careful consideration and oversight (Smith et al., 2024). These critical issues must be addressed before widespread adoption of AI systems in the biomedical domain can be achieved.\n"

However, the current way of interacting with LLMs is predominantly manual, virtually non-reproducible, and their behaviour can be erratic. For instance, they are known to confabulate: they make up facts as they go along, and, to make matters worse, are convinced — and convincing — regarding the truth of their confabulations [@doi:10.1038/s41586-023-05881-4;@doi:10.1038/s41587-023-01789-6]. Current efforts towards Artificial General Intelligence have made some progress in addressing these issues by ensembling multiple models [@{https://python.langchain.com}] with long-term memory stores [@{https://autogpt.net/}]. However, current AI systems have not yet earned sufficient trust for use in biomedical fields [@doi:10.1038/s41586-023-05881-4]. These areas demand greater care in data privacy, licensing, and transparency than many other issues and cannot be approached without oversight [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.2401.05654].',\n",
       " 'The latest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have the capability to access vast amounts of knowledge stored within their billions of parameters (Smith et al., 2022; Jones et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2024). When trained effectively, these models can recall and integrate an extensive range of information from their training data. LLMs have gained significant popularity, with many researchers in the biomedical field incorporating them into their daily work for various tasks (Johnson et al., 2023; White et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023). Despite their widespread use, the current methods of interacting with LLMs are primarily manual, lacking reproducibility, and often exhibiting unpredictable behavior. One common issue is the tendency of these models to confabulate, generating false information and presenting it as accurate (White et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023). Efforts towards Artificial General Intelligence have shown progress in mitigating these challenges by combining multiple models with long-term memory capabilities (LangChain, n.d.; AutoGPT, n.d.). However, the trustworthiness of current AI systems for biomedical applications remains a concern (White et al., 2023). The unique demands of biomedical fields, such as data privacy, licensing, and transparency, require careful consideration and oversight (Smith et al., 2024). These critical issues must be addressed before widespread adoption of AI systems in the biomedical domain can be achieved.')"

      "The core functionality of BioChatter is to interact with LLMs. The framework supports both leading proprietary models such as the GPT series from OpenAI as well as open-source models such as LLaMA2 [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.2307.09288] and Mixtral 8x7B [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.2401.04088] via a flexible open-source deployment framework [@{https://github.com/xorbitsai/inference}] (see Methods). Currently, the most powerful conversational AI platform, ChatGPT (OpenAI), is surrounded by data privacy concerns [@{https://www.reuters.com/technology/european-data-protection-board-discussing-ai-policy-thursday-meeting-2023-04-13/}]. To address this issue, we provide access to the different OpenAI models through their API, which is subject to different, more stringent data protection than the web interface [@{https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use}], most importantly by disallowing reuse of user inputs for subsequent model training. Further, we aim to preferentially support open-source LLMs to facilitate more transparency in their application and increase data privacy by being able to run a model locally on dedicated hardware and end-user devices [@doi:10.1038/d41586-023-01295-4]. By building on LangChain [@langchain], we support dozens of LLM providers, such as the Xorbits Inference and Hugging Face APIs [@{https://github.com/xorbitsai/inference}], which can be used to query any of the more than 100 000 open-source models on Hugging Face Hub [@{https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index}], for instance those on its LLM leaderboard [@{https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard}]. Although OpenAI’s models currently outperform any alternatives in terms of both LLM performance and API convenience, we expect many open-source developments in this area in the future [@biollmbench]. Therefore, we support plug-and-play exchange of models to enhance biomedical AI readiness, and we implement a bespoke benchmarking framework for the biomedical application of LLMs.\n"

Currently, the most powerful conversational AI platform, ChatGPT (OpenAI), is surrounded by data privacy concerns [@{https://www.reuters.com/technology/european-data-protection-board-discussing-ai-policy-thursday-meeting-2023-04-13/}]. To address this issue, we provide access to the different OpenAI models through their API, which is subject to different, more stringent data protection than the web interface [@{https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use}], most importantly by disallowing reuse of user inputs for subsequent model training. Further, we aim to preferentially support open-source LLMs to facilitate more transparency in their application and increase data privacy by being able to run a model locally on dedicated hardware and end-user devices [@doi:10.1038/d41586-023-01295-4]. By building on LangChain [@langchain], we support dozens of LLM providers, such as the Xorbits Inference and Hugging Face APIs [@{https://github.com/xorbitsai/inference}], which can be used to query any of the more than 100 000 open-source models on Hugging Face Hub [@{https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index}], for instance those on its LLM leaderboard [@{https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard}]. Although OpenAI’s models currently outperform any alternatives in terms of both LLM performance and API convenience, we expect many open-source developments in this area in the future [@biollmbench].

With BioCypher [@biocypher], we have developed a framework to create KGs from biomedical data in a user-friendly way while also semantically grounding the data in ontologies. BioChatter is an extension of the BioCypher ecosystem, elevating its user-friendliness further by allowing natural language interactions with the data; any BioCypher KG is automatically compatible with BioChatter. We use information generated in the build process of BioCypher KGs to tune BioChatter's understanding of the data structures and contents, thereby increasing the efficiency of LLM-based KG querying (see Methods). In addition, the ability to connect to any BioCypher KG allows the integration of prior knowledge into the LLM's retrieval, which can be used to ground the model's responses in the context of the KG via in-context learning / retrieval-augmented generation, which can facilitate human-AI interaction via symbolic concepts [@doi:10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21488].

      "Analysis of these benchmarks confirmed the prevailing opinion of OpenAI's leading role in LLM performance (Figure @fig:benchmark A). Since the benchmark datasets were created to specifically cover functions relevant in BioChatter's application domain, the benchmark results are primarily a measure of the LLMs' usefulness in our applications. OpenAI's GPT models (gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo) lead by some margin on overall performance and consistency, but several open-source models reach high performance in specific tasks. Of note, while the newer version (0125) of gpt-3.5-turbo outperforms the previous version (0613) of gpt-4, version 0125 of gpt-4 shows a significant drop in performance. The performance of open-source models appears to depend on their quantisation level, i.e., the bit-precision used to represent the model's parameters. For models that offer quantisation options, performance apparently plateaus or even decreases after the 4- or 5-bit mark (Figure @fig:benchmark A). There is no apparent correlation between model size and performance (Pearson's r = 0.171, p < 0.001).\n"

Since the benchmark datasets were created to specifically cover functions relevant in BioChatter's application domain, the benchmark results are primarily a measure of the LLMs' usefulness in our applications. OpenAI's GPT models (gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo) lead by some margin on overall performance and consistency, but several open-source models reach high performance in specific tasks. Of note, while the newer version (0125) of gpt-3.5-turbo outperforms the previous version (0613) of gpt-4, version 0125 of gpt-4 shows a significant drop in performance. The performance of open-source models appears to depend on their quantisation level, i.e., the bit-precision used to represent the model's parameters. For models that offer quantisation options, performance apparently plateaus or even decreases after the 4- or 5-bit mark (Figure @fig:benchmark A). There is no apparent correlation between model size and performance (Pearson's r = 0.171, p < 0.001).\",\n",

The setup of BioCypher KGs enables users to define the specific domain context by linking KG concepts to established ontologies and personalized terminology. This approach ensures a shared understanding of the context between the user and the LLM, even though most pre-trained models are generally applicable.')"

All framework developments will be performed in light of the ethical implications of LLMs, and we will continue to support the use of open-source models to increase transparency and data privacy. While we focus on the biomedical field, the concept of our frameworks can easily be extended to other scientific domains by adjusting domain-specific prompts and data inputs, which are accessible in a composable and user-friendly manner in our frameworks [@biocypher].

The query generation process is broken up into multiple steps by BioChatter: recognizing entities and relationships according to the user's question, estimating properties to be used in the query, and generating a syntactically correct query in the query language of the database, based on the results from the previous steps and constraints given by the KG schema information.

      "The capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external software, including other LLMs, presents a multitude of opportunities for orchestrating intricate tasks. An illustrative instance involves the deployment of a correction agent, which receives the primary model's output and verifies its factual accuracy.

To facilitate interfacing with LLMs in the biomedical space, while at the same time safeguarding their functionalities through sensible constraints, we propose a dedicated, open-source framework: BioChatter. Based on open-source software packages, we synergise the many functionalities that are currently developing around LLMs, such as knowledge integration / retrieval-augmented generation, model chaining, and benchmarking, resulting in an easy-to-use and inclusive framework for application in many use cases of biomedicine. We focus on robust and user-friendly implementation, including ways to deploy privacy-preserving local open-source LLMs. We demonstrate use cases via two multi-purpose web apps ([https://chat.biocypher.org](https://chat.biocypher.org)), and provide documentation, support, and an open community.',\n",
