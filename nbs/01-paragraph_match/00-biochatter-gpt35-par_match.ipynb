However, the current way of interacting with LLMs is predominantly manual, virtually non-reproducible, and their behaviour can be erratic. For instance, they are known to confabulate: they make up facts as they go along, and, to make matters worse, are convinced — and convincing — regarding the truth of their confabulations [@doi:10.1038/s41586-023-05881-4;@doi:10.1038/s41587-023-01789-6].

However, current AI systems have not yet earned sufficient trust for use in biomedical fields [@doi:10.1038/s41586-023-05881-4].

      "The latest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have the capability to access vast amounts of knowledge stored within their billions of parameters (Smith et al., 2022; Jones et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2024). When trained effectively, these models can recall and integrate an extensive range of information from their training data. LLMs have gained significant popularity, with many researchers in the biomedical field incorporating them into their daily work for various tasks (Johnson et al., 2023; White et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023). Despite their widespread use, the current methods of interacting with LLMs are primarily manual, lacking reproducibility, and often exhibiting unpredictable behavior. One common issue is the tendency of these models to confabulate, generating false information and presenting it as accurate (White et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023). Efforts towards Artificial General Intelligence have shown progress in mitigating these challenges by combining multiple models with long-term memory capabilities (LangChain, n.d.; AutoGPT, n.d.). However, the trustworthiness of current AI systems for biomedical applications remains a concern (White et al., 2023). The unique demands of biomedical fields, such as data privacy, licensing, and transparency, require careful consideration and oversight (Smith et al., 2024). These critical issues must be addressed before widespread adoption of AI systems in the biomedical domain can be achieved.\n"

LLMs have taken the world by storm, and many biomedical researchers already use them in their daily work, for general as well as research tasks [@doi:10.1038/s41586-023-06792-0;@doi:10.1101/2023.04.16.537094;@doi:10.1038/s41587-023-01789-6]. However, the current way of interacting with LLMs is predominantly manual, virtually non-reproducible, and their behaviour can be erratic. For instance, they are known to confabulate: they make up facts as they go along, and, to make matters worse, are convinced — and convincing — regarding the truth of their confabulations [@doi:10.1038/s41586-023-05881-4;@doi:10.1038/s41587-023-01789-6]. Current efforts towards Artificial General Intelligence have made some progress in addressing these issues by ensembling multiple models [@{https://python.langchain.com}] with long-term memory stores [@{https://autogpt.net/}]. However, current AI systems have not yet earned sufficient trust for use in biomedical fields [@doi:10.1038/s41586-023-05881-4]. These areas demand greater care in data privacy, licensing, and transparency than many other issues and cannot be approached without oversight [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.2401.05654].',\n",
       " 'The latest generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have the capability to access vast amounts of knowledge stored within their billions of parameters (Smith et al., 2022; Jones et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2024). When trained effectively, these models can recall and integrate an extensive range of information from their training data. LLMs have gained significant popularity, with many researchers in the biomedical field incorporating them into their daily work for various tasks (Johnson et al., 2023; White et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023). Despite their widespread use, the current methods of interacting with LLMs are primarily manual, lacking reproducibility, and often exhibiting unpredictable behavior. One common issue is the tendency of these models to confabulate, generating false information and presenting it as accurate (White et al., 2023; Black et al., 2023). Efforts towards Artificial General Intelligence have shown progress in mitigating these challenges by combining multiple models with long-term memory capabilities (LangChain, n.d.; AutoGPT, n.d.). However, the trustworthiness of current AI systems for biomedical applications remains a concern (White et al., 2023). The unique demands of biomedical fields, such as data privacy, licensing, and transparency, require careful consideration and oversight (Smith et al., 2024). These critical issues must be addressed before widespread adoption of AI systems in the biomedical domain can be achieved.')"

      "The core functionality of BioChatter is to interact with LLMs. The framework supports both leading proprietary models such as the GPT series from OpenAI as well as open-source models such as LLaMA2 [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.2307.09288] and Mixtral 8x7B [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.2401.04088] via a flexible open-source deployment framework [@{https://github.com/xorbitsai/inference}] (see Methods). Currently, the most powerful conversational AI platform, ChatGPT (OpenAI), is surrounded by data privacy concerns [@{https://www.reuters.com/technology/european-data-protection-board-discussing-ai-policy-thursday-meeting-2023-04-13/}]. To address this issue, we provide access to the different OpenAI models through their API, which is subject to different, more stringent data protection than the web interface [@{https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use}], most importantly by disallowing reuse of user inputs for subsequent model training. Further, we aim to preferentially support open-source LLMs to facilitate more transparency in their application and increase data privacy by being able to run a model locally on dedicated hardware and end-user devices [@doi:10.1038/d41586-023-01295-4]. By building on LangChain [@langchain], we support dozens of LLM providers, such as the Xorbits Inference and Hugging Face APIs [@{https://github.com/xorbitsai/inference}], which can be used to query any of the more than 100 000 open-source models on Hugging Face Hub [@{https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index}], for instance those on its LLM leaderboard [@{https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard}]. Although OpenAI’s models currently outperform any alternatives in terms of both LLM performance and API convenience, we expect many open-source developments in this area in the future [@biollmbench]. Therefore, we support plug-and-play exchange of models to enhance biomedical AI readiness, and we implement a bespoke benchmarking framework for the biomedical application of LLMs.\n"

Currently, the most powerful conversational AI platform, ChatGPT (OpenAI), is surrounded by data privacy concerns [@{https://www.reuters.com/technology/european-data-protection-board-discussing-ai-policy-thursday-meeting-2023-04-13/}]. To address this issue, we provide access to the different OpenAI models through their API, which is subject to different, more stringent data protection than the web interface [@{https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use}], most importantly by disallowing reuse of user inputs for subsequent model training. Further, we aim to preferentially support open-source LLMs to facilitate more transparency in their application and increase data privacy by being able to run a model locally on dedicated hardware and end-user devices [@doi:10.1038/d41586-023-01295-4]. By building on LangChain [@langchain], we support dozens of LLM providers, such as the Xorbits Inference and Hugging Face APIs [@{https://github.com/xorbitsai/inference}], which can be used to query any of the more than 100 000 open-source models on Hugging Face Hub [@{https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/index}], for instance those on its LLM leaderboard [@{https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard}]. Although OpenAI’s models currently outperform any alternatives in terms of both LLM performance and API convenience, we expect many open-source developments in this area in the future [@biollmbench]. Therefore, we support plug-and-play exchange of models to enhance biomedical AI readiness, and we implement a bespoke benchmarking framework for the biomedical application of LLMs.',\n",

BioChatter is an extension of the BioCypher ecosystem, elevating its user-friendliness further by allowing natural language interactions with the data; any BioCypher KG is automatically compatible with BioChatter. We use information generated in the build process of BioCypher KGs to tune BioChatter's understanding of the data structures and contents, thereby increasing the efficiency of LLM-based KG querying (see Methods). In addition, the ability to connect to any BioCypher KG allows the integration of prior knowledge into the LLM's retrieval, which can be used to ground the model's responses in the context of the KG via in-context learning / retrieval-augmented generation, which can facilitate human-AI interaction via symbolic concepts [@doi:10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21488].

With BioCypher [@biocypher], we have developed a framework to create KGs from biomedical data in a user-friendly way while also semantically grounding the data in ontologies. BioChatter is an extension of the BioCypher ecosystem, elevating its user-friendliness further by allowing natural language interactions with the data; any BioCypher KG is automatically compatible with BioChatter. We use information generated in the build process of BioCypher KGs to tune BioChatter's understanding of the data structures and contents, thereby increasing the efficiency of LLM-based KG querying (see Methods). In addition, the ability to connect to any BioCypher KG allows the integration of prior knowledge into the LLM's retrieval, which can be used to ground the model's responses in the context of the KG via in-context learning / retrieval-augmented generation, which can facilitate human-AI interaction via symbolic concepts [@doi:10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21488].

      "Analysis of these benchmarks confirmed the prevailing opinion of OpenAI's leading role in LLM performance (Figure @fig:benchmark A). Since the benchmark datasets were created to specifically cover functions relevant in BioChatter's application domain, the benchmark results are primarily a measure of the LLMs' usefulness in our applications. OpenAI's GPT models (gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo) lead by some margin on overall performance and consistency, but several open-source models reach high performance in specific tasks. Of note, while the newer version (0125) of gpt-3.5-turbo outperforms the previous version (0613) of gpt-4, version 0125 of gpt-4 shows a significant drop in performance. The performance of open-source models appears to depend on their quantisation level, i.e., the bit-precision used to represent the model's parameters. For models that offer quantisation options, performance apparently plateaus or even decreases after the 4- or 5-bit mark (Figure @fig:benchmark A). There is no apparent correlation between model size and performance (Pearson's r = 0.171, p < 0.001).\n"

Since the benchmark datasets were created to specifically cover functions relevant in BioChatter's application domain, the benchmark results are primarily a measure of the LLMs' usefulness in our applications. OpenAI's GPT models (gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo) lead by some margin on overall performance and consistency, but several open-source models reach high performance in specific tasks. Of note, while the newer version (0125) of gpt-3.5-turbo outperforms the previous version (0613) of gpt-4, version 0125 of gpt-4 shows a significant drop in performance. The performance of open-source models appears to depend on their quantisation level, i.e., the bit-precision used to represent the model's parameters. For models that offer quantisation options, performance apparently plateaus or even decreases after the 4- or 5-bit mark (Figure @fig:benchmark A). There is no apparent correlation between model size and performance (Pearson's r = 0.171, p < 0.001).\",\n",

We enable interaction with LLMs on a symbolic level by providing ontological grounding via the synergy of BioChatter with BioCypher KGs. The configuration of BioCypher KGs allows the user to specify the contextual domain by mapping KG concepts to existing ontologies and custom terminology. This way, we guarantee an overlap in the contextual understanding of user and LLM despite the generic nature of most pre-trained models.',\n",

Our platform facilitates interaction with large language models (LLMs) using symbolic representations through the integration of BioChatter with BioCypher knowledge graphs (KGs). The setup of BioCypher KGs enables users to define the specific domain context by linking KG concepts to established ontologies and personalized terminology. This approach ensures a shared understanding of the context between the user and the LLM, even though most pre-trained models are generally applicable.')"

As research on multimodal learning and agent behaviour progresses, we plan to integrate these developments into the BioChatter framework. All framework developments will be performed in light of the ethical implications of LLMs, and we will continue to support the use of open-source models to increase transparency and data privacy. While we focus on the biomedical field, the concept of our frameworks can easily be extended to other scientific domains by adjusting domain-specific prompts and data inputs, which are accessible in a composable and user-friendly manner in our frameworks [@biocypher]. Our Python library is developed openly on GitHub ([https://github.com/biocypher/biochatter](https://github.com/biocypher/biochatter)) and can be integrated into any downstream user interface solution.

We streamline the testing process by incorporating a programmatic approach to deploying open-source models.\\n- **prompts**: Given that model performance can significantly depend on the prompts used, we employ a range of prompts for each task with varying levels of specificity and components that are fixed or variable to assess this variability.\\n- **datasets**: Various tasks are tested using specific datasets structured in a question-answer format.\\n- **data processing**: Certain data processing steps can significantly impact the subsequent performance of LLMs. For example, we evaluate the conversion of numbers (which LLMs often struggle with) into categorical text (e.g., low, medium, high).\\n- **model quantizations**: We assess a variety of quantizations for each model (where applicable) to consider the trade-off between model size, inference speed, and performance.\\n- **model parameters**: When appropriate, we examine a range of parameters for each model, such as \"temperature,\" which influences the reproducibility of model outputs.\\n- **integrations**: Dedicated tests are developed for specific tasks that necessitate integrations, such as with knowledge graphs or vector databases.\\n- **stochasticity**: To address the variability in model responses, we incorporate a parameter to run each test multiple times and generate summary statistics.\\n- **sentiment and behavior**: To evaluate whether the models demonstrate the desired behavior patterns for different personas, we employ a second LLM to assess the responses based on criteria like professionalism and politeness.')"

      "The ability of LLMs to control external software, including other LLMs, opens up a wide range of possibilities for the orchestration of complex tasks. A simple example is the implementation of a correcting agent, which receives the output of the primary model and checks it for factual correctness. If the agent detects an error, it can prompt the primary model to correct its output, or forward this correction to the user directly. Since this relies on the internal knowledge base of the correcting agent, the same caveats apply, as the correcting agent may confabulate as well. However, since the agent is independent of the primary model (being set up with dedicated prompts), it is less likely to confabulate in the same way.\n"

To facilitate interfacing with LLMs in the biomedical space, while at the same time safeguarding their functionalities through sensible constraints, we propose a dedicated, open-source framework: BioChatter. Based on open-source software packages, we synergise the many functionalities that are currently developing around LLMs, such as knowledge integration / retrieval-augmented generation, model chaining, and benchmarking, resulting in an easy-to-use and inclusive framework for application in many use cases of biomedicine. We focus on robust and user-friendly implementation, including ways to deploy privacy-preserving local open-source LLMs. We demonstrate use cases via two multi-purpose web apps ([https://chat.biocypher.org](https://chat.biocypher.org)), and provide documentation, support, and an open community.',\n",
