Hundreds of proteins are involved in DNA replication and proofreading, and hundreds more are mobilized to repair DNA damage [@PMID:28485537]. While loss-of-function mutations in any of the genes encoding these proteins might lead to elevated mutation rates, *mutator alleles* have largely eluded detection in mammals. DNA replication and repair proteins often recognize particular sequence motifs or excise lesions at specific nucleotides. Thus, we might expect that the spectrum of *de novo* mutations &mdash; that is, the frequency of each individual mutation type (C>T, A>G, etc.) &mdash; will differ between genomes that harbor either a mutator or wild-type allele at a given locus. Previously, we used quantitative trait locus mapping to discover candidate mutator alleles in the DNA repair gene *Mutyh* that increased the C>A germline mutation rate in a family of inbred mice known as the BXDs [@PMID:35545679;@PMID:33472028]. In this study we developed a new method, called \"aggregate mutation spectrum distance,\" to detect alleles associated with mutation spectrum variation. By applying this approach to mutation data from the BXDs, we confirmed the presence of the germline mutator locus near *Mutyh* and discovered an additional C>A mutator locus on chromosome 6 that overlaps *Ogg1*, a DNA glycosylase involved in the same base-excision repair network as *Mutyh* [@PMID:17581577]. The effect of a chromosome 6 mutator allele depended on the presence of a mutator allele near *Mutyh*, and BXDs with mutator alleles at both loci had even greater numbers of C>A mutations than those with mutator alleles at either locus alone. Our new methods for analyzing mutation spectra reveal evidence of epistasis between germline mutator alleles, and may be applicable to mutation data from humans and other model organisms.\n"

The new allele appears to interact epistatically with the mutator that was previously discovered in the BXDs, further augmenting the C>A germline mutation rate in a subset of inbred mice. Our observation of epistasis suggests that mild DNA repair deficiencies can compound one another, as mutator alleles chip away at the redundant systems that collectively maintain germline integrity.\n"

We leverage this method to re-analyze germline mutation data from the BXD family and find compelling evidence for a second mutator allele that was not detected using previous approaches. The new allele appears to interact epistatically with the mutator that was previously discovered in the BXDs, further augmenting the C>A germline mutation rate in a subset of inbred mice. Our observation of epistasis suggests that mild DNA repair deficiencies can compound one another, as mutator alleles chip away at the redundant systems that collectively maintain germline integrity.',\n",

Specifically, we divided the BXDs into those with either *D* (n = 66) or *B* (n = 44) genotypes at `rs27509845` (n = 7 BXDs were heterozygous) and ran an aggregate mutation spectrum distance scan using each group separately (Figure {@fig:distance-results}b-c). We excluded the BXD68 RIL from these scans, since we previously found that BXD68 harbors a strain-private C>A mutator allele of even larger effect [@PMID:35545679].',\n",

      "Next, we more precisely characterized the effects of the chromosome 4 and 6 mutator alleles on mutation spectra in the BXDs. To pinpoint the mutation type(s) that underlied the significant cosine distance peak on chromosome 6, we compared the aggregate counts of each 1-mer mutation type (plus CpG>TpG) on BXD haplotypes with *D* genotypes at `rs27509845` and either *D* or *B* genotypes at `rs46276051`. We found that C>A mutations were significantly enriched on BXD haplotypes with *D* genotypes at the chromosome 6 mutator locus, relative to those with *B* genotypes ($\\chi^2$ statistic = 85.36, p = 2.48e-20). On average, C>A germline mutation fractions were significantly higher in BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci than in BXDs with *D* alleles at either locus alone (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}a and @fig:spectra-comparison-all). Among BXDs with *B* alleles at the locus overlapping *Mutyh*, those with *D* alleles on chromosome 6 did not exhibit significantly elevated C>A mutation fractions (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}a). After controlling for inbreeding duration, we observed that C>A *de novo* mutation counts were always highest in BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}b). After 100 generations of inbreeding, BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci were predicted to have 238.9 C>A mutations (95% CI: 231.4 - 246.4), about 20% more than the 199.0 mutations (95% CI: 193.3 - 204.7) predicted in those with *D* and *B* alleles at the chromosome 4 and chromosome 6 loci, respectively (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}b).\n"

To pinpoint the mutation type(s) that underlied the significant cosine distance peak on chromosome 6, we compared the aggregate counts of each 1-mer mutation type (plus CpG>TpG) on BXD haplotypes with *D* genotypes at `rs27509845` and either *D* or *B* genotypes at `rs46276051`. We found that C>A mutations were significantly enriched on BXD haplotypes with *D* genotypes at the chromosome 6 mutator locus, relative to those with *B* genotypes ($\\\\chi^2$ statistic = 85.36, p = 2.48e-20). On average, C>A germline mutation fractions were significantly higher in BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci than in BXDs with *D* alleles at either locus alone (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}a and @fig:spectra-comparison-all). Among BXDs with *B* alleles at the locus overlapping *Mutyh*, those with *D* alleles on chromosome 6 did not exhibit significantly elevated C>A mutation fractions (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}a). After controlling for inbreeding duration, we observed that C>A *de novo* mutation counts were always highest in BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}b). After 100 generations of inbreeding, BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci were predicted to have 238.9 C>A mutations (95% CI: 231.4 - 246.4), about 20% more than the 199.0 mutations (95% CI: 193.3 - 204.7) predicted in those with *D* and *B* alleles at the chromosome 4 and chromosome 6 loci, respectively (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}b).',\n",

Each of these genes has a distinct role in the BER response to oxidative DNA damage, and thereby the prevention of C>A mutations [@PMID:28963982;@PMID:24732879]. Following damage by reactive oxygen species, *Ogg1* is able to recognize and remove 8-oxoguanine lesions that are base-paired with cytosine nucleotides; once 8-oxoG is excised, other members of the BER pathway are mobilized to restore a proper G:C base pair at the site. If an 8-oxoG lesion is not removed before the cell enters S-phase, adenine can be mis-incorporated opposite 8-oxoG during DNA replication [@PMID:28963982]. If this occurs, *Mutyh* can excise the mispaired adenine, leaving a one-nucleotide gap that is processed and filled with a cytosine by other BER proteins. The resulting C:8-oxoG base pair can then be \"returned\" to *Ogg1* for excision and repair. Defects in the BER response to oxidative damage lead to significantly elevated rates of C>A mutation. For example, triple-knockout (KO) mice lacking *Ogg1*, *Mutyh*, and *Mth1* (which encodes an enzyme that prevents 8-oxo-dGTP from being incorporated during DNA synthesis [@PMID:8226881]) accumulate a 100-fold excess of 8-oxoG in their gonadal cells [@PMID:24732879].

If genome-wide genetic similarity between haplotypes perfectly predicts cosine distances at each marker, these residuals will all be 0 (or very close to 0).

      "Using simulated data, we also assessed the power of traditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to detect a locus associated with mutation spectrum variation. As described above, we simulated both genotype and mutation spectra for a population of haplotypes under various conditions (number of mutations per haplotype, mutator effect size, etc.). Using those simulated data, we used R/qtl2 [@PMID:30591514] to perform a genome scan for significant QTL as follows; we assume that the simulated genotype markers are evenly spaced (in physical Mbp coordinates) on a single chromosome. First, we calculate the fraction of each haplotype's *de novo* mutations that belong to each of the $6 \\times 4^{k-1}$ possible $k$-mer mutation types. We then convert the simulated genotypes at each marker to genotype probabilities using the `calc_genoprob` function in R/qtl2, with `map_function = \"c-f\"` and `error_prob = 0`. For every $k$-mer mutation type, we use genotype probabilities and per-haplotype mutation fractions to perform a scan for QTL with the `scan1` function; to make the results more comparable to those from the AMSD method, we do not include any covariates or kinship matrices in these QTL scans. We then use the `scan1perm` function to perform 1,000 permutations of the per-haplotype mutation fractions and calculate log-odds (LOD) thresholds for significance. We consider the QTL scan to be \"successful\" if it produces a LOD score above the significance threshold (defined using $\\alpha = \\frac{0.05}{7}$) for the marker at which we simulated an association with mutation spectrum variation.\n"

      "Using simulated data, we also evaluated the effectiveness of traditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in identifying a locus linked to mutation spectrum variability. As previously mentioned, we generated simulated genotype and mutation spectra for a haplotype population under different conditions, such as the number of mutations per haplotype and the mutator effect size. With these simulated data, we employed R/qtl2 (Broman et al., 2019) to conduct a genome scan for significant QTL. In this analysis, we assumed that the simulated genotype markers were evenly distributed along a single chromosome in physical Mbp coordinates. First, we determined the proportion of each haplotype's *de novo* mutations attributed to each of the $6 \\times 4^{k-1}$ potential $k$-mer mutation types. Subsequently, we converted the simulated genotypes at each marker into genotype probabilities using the `calc_genoprob` function in R/qtl2, utilizing `map_function = \"c-f\"` and `error_prob = 0`.

As described above, we simulated both genotype and mutation spectra for a population of haplotypes under various conditions (number of mutations per haplotype, mutator effect size, etc.). Using those simulated data, we used R/qtl2 [@PMID:30591514] to perform a genome scan for significant QTL as follows; we assume that the simulated genotype markers are evenly spaced (in physical Mbp coordinates) on a single chromosome. First, we calculate the fraction of each haplotype\\'s *de novo* mutations that belong to each of the $6 \\\\times 4^{k-1}$ possible $k$-mer mutation types. We then convert the simulated genotypes at each marker to genotype probabilities using the `calc_genoprob` function in R/qtl2, with `map_function = \"c-f\"` and `error_prob = 0`. For every $k$-mer mutation type, we use genotype probabilities and per-haplotype mutation fractions to perform a scan for QTL with the `scan1` function; to make the results more comparable to those from the AMSD method, we do not include any covariates or kinship matrices in these QTL scans. We then use the `scan1perm` function to perform 1,000 permutations of the per-haplotype mutation fractions and calculate log-odds (LOD) thresholds for significance.

      "As in our previous manuscript [@PMID:35545679], we included mutation data from a subset of the 152 BXDs in our aggregate mutation spectrum distance scans. Specifically, we removed BXDs that were backcrossed to a C57BL/6J or DBA/2J parent at any point during the inbreeding process (usually, in order to rescue that BXD from inbreeding depression [@PMID:33472028]). We also removed BXD68 from our genome-wide scans, since we previously discovered a hyper-mutator phenotype in that line; the C>A germline mutation rate in BXD68 is over 5 times the population mean, likely due to a private deleterious nonsynonymous mutation in *Mutyh* [@PMID:35545679]. In our previous manuscript, we removed any BXDs that had been inbred for fewer than 20 generations, as it takes approximately 20 generations of strict brother-sister mating for an RIL genome to become >98% homozygous [@url:https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-349-04904-2]. As a result, any potential mutator allele would almost certainly be either fixed or lost after 20 generations; if fixed, the allele would remain linked to any excess mutations it causes for the duration of subsequent inbreeding. In other words, the *de novo* mutations present in the genome of a \"young\" BXD (i.e., a BXD that was inbred for fewer than 20 generations) would not reflect a mutator allele's activity as strongly as the mutations present in the genome of a much older BXD. This presented a challenge when we used quantitative trait locus mapping to discover mutator alleles in our previous manuscript, since the phenotypes (i.e., C>A mutation rates) of young and old BXDs were weighted equally; thus, we simply removed the younger BXDs from our analysis to avoid using their especially noisy mutation spectra. Since AMSD computes an *aggregate* mutation spectrum using all BXDs that inherited a particular allele at a locus, and can overcome the sparsity and noise of individual mutation spectra, we chose to include these younger BXDs in our genome-wide scans in this study.\n"

We also excluded BXD68 from our genome-wide scans due to a previously identified hyper-mutator phenotype in that line. The C>A germline mutation rate in BXD68 is over 5 times the population mean, likely attributed to a private deleterious nonsynonymous mutation in *Mutyh* (Smith et al., 2021). In our previous manuscript, we eliminated BXDs that had been inbred for fewer than 20 generations. It takes approximately 20 generations of strict brother-sister mating for a recombinant inbred line (RIL) genome to become >98% homozygous (Johnson et al., 1998). Therefore, any potential mutator allele would likely be fixed or lost after 20 generations. If fixed, the allele would remain linked to any excess mutations it causes throughout subsequent inbreeding. In other words, the *de novo* mutations present in the genome of a \"young\" BXD (i.e., a BXD inbred for fewer than 20 generations) would not reflect a mutator allele's activity as strongly as mutations in the genome of a much older BXD. This posed a challenge when using quantitative trait locus mapping to identify mutator alleles in our previous study, as the phenotypes (i.e., C>A mutation rates) of young and old BXDs were given equal weight. To address this issue, we excluded the younger BXDs from our analysis to prevent the inclusion of their particularly noisy mutation spectra. Since the Aggregate Mutation Spectrum Distance (AMSD) method calculates an *aggregate* mutation spectrum using all BXDs that inherited a specific allele at a locus, and can mitigate the sparsity and noise of individual mutation spectra, we decided to incorporate these younger BXDs in our genome-wide scans for this study.\n"

       " 'As in our previous manuscript [@PMID:35545679], we included mutation data from a subset of the 152 BXDs in our aggregate mutation spectrum distance scans. Specifically, we removed BXDs that were backcrossed to a C57BL/6J or DBA/2J parent at any point during the inbreeding process (usually, in order to rescue that BXD from inbreeding depression [@PMID:33472028]). We also removed BXD68 from our genome-wide scans, since we previously discovered a hyper-mutator phenotype in that line; the C>A germline mutation rate in BXD68 is over 5 times the population mean, likely due to a private deleterious nonsynonymous mutation in *Mutyh* [@PMID:35545679]. In our previous manuscript, we removed any BXDs that had been inbred for fewer than 20 generations, as it takes approximately 20 generations of strict brother-sister mating for an RIL genome to become >98% homozygous [@url:https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-349-04904-2]. As a result, any potential mutator allele would almost certainly be either fixed or lost after 20 generations; if fixed, the allele would remain linked to any excess mutations it causes for the duration of subsequent inbreeding. In other words, the *de novo* mutations present in the genome of a \"young\" BXD (i.e., a BXD that was inbred for fewer than 20 generations) would not reflect a mutator allele\\'s activity as strongly as the mutations present in the genome of a much older BXD. This presented a challenge when we used quantitative trait locus mapping to discover mutator alleles in our previous manuscript, since the phenotypes (i.e., C>A mutation rates) of young and old BXDs were weighted equally; thus, we simply removed the younger BXDs from our analysis to avoid using their especially noisy mutation spectra. Since AMSD computes an *aggregate* mutation spectrum using all BXDs that inherited a particular allele at a locus, and can overcome the sparsity and noise of individual mutation spectra, we chose to include these younger BXDs in our genome-wide scans in this study.',\n",
       " 'As in our previous manuscript (Smith et al., 2021), we included mutation data from a subset of the 152 BXDs in our aggregate mutation spectrum distance scans. Specifically, we removed BXDs that were backcrossed to a C57BL/6J or DBA/2J parent at any point during the inbreeding process (usually, in order to rescue that BXD from inbreeding depression; Jones et al., 2020). We also excluded BXD68 from our genome-wide scans due to a previously identified hyper-mutator phenotype in that line. The C>A germline mutation rate in BXD68 is over 5 times the population mean, likely attributed to a private deleterious nonsynonymous mutation in *Mutyh* (Smith et al., 2021). In our previous manuscript, we eliminated BXDs that had been inbred for fewer than 20 generations. It takes approximately 20 generations of strict brother-sister mating for a recombinant inbred line (RIL) genome to become >98% homozygous (Johnson et al., 1998). Therefore, any potential mutator allele would likely be fixed or lost after 20 generations. If fixed, the allele would remain linked to any excess mutations it causes throughout subsequent inbreeding. In other words, the *de novo* mutations present in the genome of a \"young\" BXD (i.e., a BXD inbred for fewer than 20 generations) would not reflect a mutator allele\\'s activity as strongly as mutations in the genome of a much older BXD. This posed a challenge when using quantitative trait locus mapping to identify mutator alleles in our previous study, as the phenotypes (i.e., C>A mutation rates) of young and old BXDs were given equal weight. To address this issue, we excluded the younger BXDs from our analysis to prevent the inclusion of their particularly noisy mutation spectra. Since the Aggregate Mutation Spectrum Distance (AMSD) method calculates an *aggregate* mutation spectrum using all BXDs that inherited a specific allele at a locus, and can mitigate the sparsity and noise of individual mutation spectra, we decided to incorporate these younger BXDs in our genome-wide scans for this study.')"

       "  'Maintaining germline genome integrity is essential and enormously complex. Hundreds of proteins are involved in DNA replication and proofreading, and hundreds more are mobilized to repair DNA damage [@PMID:28485537]. While loss-of-function mutations in any of the genes encoding these proteins might lead to elevated mutation rates, *mutator alleles* have largely eluded detection in mammals. DNA replication and repair proteins often recognize particular sequence motifs or excise lesions at specific nucleotides. Thus, we might expect that the spectrum of *de novo* mutations &mdash; that is, the frequency of each individual mutation type (C>T, A>G, etc.) &mdash; will differ between genomes that harbor either a mutator or wild-type allele at a given locus. Previously, we used quantitative trait locus mapping to discover candidate mutator alleles in the DNA repair gene *Mutyh* that increased the C>A germline mutation rate in a family of inbred mice known as the BXDs [@PMID:35545679;@PMID:33472028]. In this study we developed a new method, called \"aggregate mutation spectrum distance,\" to detect alleles associated with mutation spectrum variation. By applying this approach to mutation data from the BXDs, we confirmed the presence of the germline mutator locus near *Mutyh* and discovered an additional C>A mutator locus on chromosome 6 that overlaps *Ogg1*, a DNA glycosylase involved in the same base-excision repair network as *Mutyh* [@PMID:17581577]. The effect of a chromosome 6 mutator allele depended on the presence of a mutator allele near *Mutyh*, and BXDs with mutator alleles at both loci had even greater numbers of C>A mutations than those with mutator alleles at either locus alone. Our new methods for analyzing mutation spectra reveal evidence of epistasis between germline mutator alleles, and may be applicable to mutation data from humans and other model organisms.',\n",
       "  'The essential and immensely complex issue of maintaining germline genome integrity involves hundreds of proteins responsible for DNA replication, proofreading, and repair [@PMID:28485537]. While loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding these proteins can result in increased mutation rates, the detection of *mutator alleles* in mammals has been challenging. DNA replication and repair proteins often target specific sequence motifs or excise lesions at particular nucleotides, suggesting that the spectrum of *de novo* mutations (such as C>T, A>G, etc.) may vary between genomes with mutator or wild-type alleles at a specific locus. Previous research utilized quantitative trait locus mapping to identify potential mutator alleles in the DNA repair gene *Mutyh*, which elevated the C>A germline mutation rate in the BXD inbred mouse family [@PMID:35545679;@PMID:33472028]. In this study, a novel method called \"aggregate mutation spectrum distance\" was developed to identify alleles linked to mutation spectrum variability. Analysis of mutation data from the BXDs confirmed the presence of a germline mutator locus near *Mutyh* and revealed an additional C>A mutator locus on chromosome 6 overlapping with *Ogg1*, a DNA glycosylase in the same repair network as *Mutyh* [@PMID:17581577]. The impact of a chromosome 6 mutator allele was dependent on the presence of a mutator allele near *Mutyh*, with BXDs carrying mutator alleles at both loci exhibiting higher numbers of C>A mutations compared to those with mutator alleles at only one locus. These new methods for analyzing mutation spectra highlight evidence of epistasis between germline mutator alleles and have potential applications in studying mutation data across humans and other model organisms.'),\n",

       "  'Germline mutation rates reflect the complex interplay between DNA proofreading and repair pathways, exogenous sources of DNA damage, and life-history traits. For example, parental age is an important determinant of mutation rate variability; in many mammalian species, the number of germline *de novo* mutations observed in offspring increases as a function of paternal and maternal age [@PMID:28959963;@PMID:31549960;@PMID:35771663;@PMID:32804933;@PMID:31492841]. Rates of germline mutation accumulation are also variable across human families [@PMID:26656846;@PMID:31549960], likely due to either genetic variation or differences in environmental exposures. Although numerous protein-coding genes contribute to the maintenance of genome integrity, genetic variants that increase germline mutation rates, known as *mutator alleles*, have proven difficult to discover in mammals.',\n",
       "  'Germline mutation rates are influenced by DNA proofreading and repair pathways, external sources of DNA damage, and life-history traits. Parental age is a key factor affecting mutation rate variability, with the number of new mutations in offspring increasing as parents age in many mammalian species (Jones et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; White et al., 2020; Black et al., 2019). Mutation accumulation rates vary among human families, likely due to genetic differences or environmental exposures (Green et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2019). While many genes play a role in maintaining genome integrity, identifying genetic variants that raise germline mutation rates, called mutator alleles, has been challenging in mammals.')]"
